# Rock Paper Scissors 

This game was created as per The Odin Project. See: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

Play Rock Paper Scissors using the console! Use Developer Tools -> script.js and look at the console log to play.

Through this project, I learned the basics of JavaScript.

I created this 100% by myself using only the knowledge from The Odin Project.
